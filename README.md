# pptmerge: Merge Microsoft Powerpoint Presentations

I once needed to find some specific Powerpoint slides in a set of dozens of
Powerpoint files. I realised that opening all files one after another was
tedious. I thought that it would be better to have all slides in one
presentation. I found a Visual Basic script
[here](https://zoomicon.wordpress.com/2007/12/12/pptmerge-merge-multiple-powerpoint-presentations-into-a-single-ppt-file/)
that merges Powerpoint files into a new single Powerpoint presentation. With
this script I was able to merge all possible presentations into one. I could
then look for the slide in one Powerpoint file instead of in many files.

This repo contains an R script that helps you use this Visual Basic script.
